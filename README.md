Introduction: Making a scientific calculator using C programming that will be able to compute normal, complex, matrix calculation, unit conversion (temperature, length, mass, degree to radian and vice versa), trigonometric values (sine,cosine and tangent). Also uses the implementation of Shunting Yard Algorithm to evaluate lengthy expressions which utilises stacks.

Tools used: C programming language (arrays, math library, support library, graphics library).

Applications: Basic mathematic computations.
